# Supercell-jailbreak
## Notes: ##

I will add more Supercell games ipa with jailbreak check disabled in the future.

Since the main executable has been modified to apply the patches, the IPA needs to be resign by a tool like Sideloadly, therefore installing with filza will cause the game to crash

If you encounter a crash during playing, startup or whenever, open an issue with the crash logs, i will try to resolve the issue.
