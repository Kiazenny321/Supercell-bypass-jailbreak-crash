# Supercell-jailbreak
## Notes: ##

I will add more Supercell games ipa with jailbreak check disabled in the future.

I recommend you install this ipa using Filza and Appsync Unified, sideloading it could cause a login failed error.

If you encounter a crash during playing, startup or whenever, open an issue with the crash logs, i will try to resolve the issue.
