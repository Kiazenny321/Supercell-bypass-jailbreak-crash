# Supercell-jailbreak
## Notes: ##

I will try as fast as possible to update Brawl Stars, Clash of Clans and Clash Royale, beta supercell games ipa will also be a priority if they are popular enough.

If you encounter a crash during playing, startup or whenever, open an issue or contact me with the crash logs, i will try to resolve the issue.


## Download ##

Since the main executable has been modified to apply the patches, the IPA needs to be resign by a tool like [Sideloadly](https://sideloadly.io/) or If your iOS supports [TrollStore](https://github.com/opa334/TrollStore) you can also use that, therefore installing with filza can cause the game to crash.

## FAQ ##

####  Why do you make it in form of an ipa and not a deb tweak? ####
At this moment, i don't have enough information about the jailbreak detection to make a working deb tweak to patch the jailbreak detection

#### Is there a chance of getting banned from this? #### 
While i have never been banned from using modded ipa which i do for 2 years already, other popular mods on android got massive player ban so i can only say USE THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK, i am not responsible if your account is getting banned. But hey, if you arrived here, it's because you couldn't play anyway right ;)

### Enjoy being able to play again supercell games! ###
