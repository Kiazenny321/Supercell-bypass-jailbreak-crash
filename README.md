# Supercell-jailbreak
## Notes: ##

I will try as fast as possible to update Brawl Stars, Clash of Clans and Clash Royale, beta supercell games ipa will also be a priority if they are popular enough.

If you encounter a crash during playing, startup or whenever, open an issue or contact me with the crash logs, i will try to resolve the issue.


## Download ##

Since the main executable has been modified to apply the patches, the IPA needs to be resign by a tool like [Sideloadly](https://sideloadly.io/) or If your iOS supports [TrollStore](https://github.com/opa334/TrollStore) you can also use that, therefore installing with filza can cause the game to crash.

## FAQ ##

####  Why do you make it in form of an ipa and not a deb tweak? ####
At this moment, i don't have enough information about the jailbreak detection to make a working deb tweak to patch the jailbreak detection

#### Is there a chance of getting banned from this? #### 
While i have never been banned from using modded IPA which i do for 2 years already, other popular mods on android got massive player ban so i can only say USE THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK, i am not responsible if your account is getting banned. But hey, if you arrived here, it's because you couldn't play anyway right ;)

#### Why are in app purchases blocked ? ####
Any repackaged IPA and the same applies for Android with repackaged APKs, they has not been officially installed from the store and in app purchases are disabled. Hopefully with Supercell there is a workaround and it's to use their store here [https://store.supercell.com/](https://store.supercell.com/) to make purchases to your account (and it have a better value than the real game purchase)

### Enjoy being able to play again supercell games! ###
